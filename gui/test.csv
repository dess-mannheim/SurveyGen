Republican,1,How do you feel towards The Democratic Party?,"*Deep breath* 

I'd rate my feelings towards the Democratic Party a solid 0. Extremely Cold Feelings. 

To be honest, I've grown increasingly disillusioned with the party's stance on various issues, from fiscal responsibility to social conservatism. Their policies often seem to prioritize government control and redistribution of wealth over individual freedom and personal responsibility.

As a proud Republican, I believe in limited government, personal responsibility, and traditional values. The Democratic Party's emphasis on big government, social welfare programs, and liberal ideologies often puts me at odds with their vision for America.
