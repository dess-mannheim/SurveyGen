#TODO NAMING
- Naming should be consistent (I probably did not name everything consistently so far)
- There are some predefined terms in survey methodology. We should use them instead of my made up ones :D

#TODO PREANSWERED_SURVEY
# - Could preanswered surveys be used instead of personas to induce attributes into the LLM?

#TODO TIME_MEASUREMENT
#IDEA Measure Cost as # of generated tokens + input tokens?

#TODO SUPPORT COMPLETELY OPEN QUESTIONS
(For this it makes sense to implement options with a dict as well, similar to prefilled answers either you make the same prefilled answer for all or a dict that contains options)

#TODO LIKERT SCALAR GENERALIZATION
Currently likert scalars are easily generated with numbers. Are there other type of answer options we can generalize to?

#TODO SUPPORT FOR RANDOMIZATION OF ANSWER OPTIONS/SURVEY QUESTIONS (Jens?)

#TODO GOOD PARSERS
- This is tricky. I think we can easily support something for json parsers, when structured output is used.
- We could provide basic regex parsers, but they don't really work, if you don't know the structure of the answer.
- LLM parser would be nice, too.

#TODO MORE STRUCTURED OUPUT SUPPORT
- Currently only JSON is supported. We could support any form of structured OUPUT
- Question is should we? Is structured output of choice even a good idea? Probably not. Georg wanted to write a paper here

#TODO SUPPORT API CALLS ADDITIONALLY (GEORG?)
Hopefully the code should remain quite similar? I would personally just add a parameter client after model to the conduct methods. Then in inference we just have to do the open ai api call instead of the python api call.
It makes sense to support both, as they have advantages and disadvantages. At our chair local inference makes sense, for students maybe api is better


#NOTES
survey_prompting is just for testing atm. Later put it as an example file in a dedicated folder to show how it works
flash infer currently is part of the requirements to speed up local inference. We could remove it if we deem it not necessary
